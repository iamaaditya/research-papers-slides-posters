# Abstract

We present an automatic technique for creating a video summary of chalkboard and whiteboard lectures
with the speaker removed, and for generating a set of slides containing all of the written content but without
the lecturer present. Our system works by continuously subtracting the lecturer from the video feed using
a region based correlation feature. The final presentation slides are extracted from this new version of the
video that no longer contains the speaker.
