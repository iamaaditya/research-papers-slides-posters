# Abstract
We present a method to extend the idea of sprite coding to videos containing a wide variety of naturally occurring background motion, which could potentially be incorporated into existing and future video standards. The existing MPEG-4 part 2 standard, now almost 20 years old, provides the ability to store objects in separate layers, and includes a sprite mode where the background layer is generated by cropping a still image based on frame-wide global motion parameters, but videos containing more general background motion cannot be effectively encoded with sprite mode. We propose a perceptually motivated lossy compression algorithm, where oscillatory background motion can be compactly encoded. Our model achieves a low bit rate by referencing a time-invariant representation of the optical flow with only a few added parameters per frame. At very low bit rates, our technique can provide dynamic backgrounds at a visual quality that may not be achievable by traditional methods which are known to produce unacceptable blocking and ringing artifacts.
