ABSTRACT

Reconstructing Self Organizing Maps as Spider 
Graphs for better visual interpretation of large 
unstructured datasets

Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are popular unsupervised 
artificial neural network used to reduce dimensions 
and visualize data.  Visual interpretation from 
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) has been limited due to 
grid approach of data representation, which makes 
inter-scenario analysis impossible. The paper 
proposes a new way to structure SOM. This model 
reconstructs SOM to show strength between variables 
as the threads of a cobweb and illuminate inter-
scenario analysis. While Radar Graphs are very 
crude representation of spider web, this model uses 
more lively and realistic cobweb representation to 
take into account the difference in strength and 
length of threads. This model allows for 
visualization of highly unstructured dataset with 
large number of dimensions, common in Bigdata 
sources.
