ABSTRACT 

New Interface Protocol to Connect Multiple Bank Networks from a 
Single Outlet

We propose an innovative interface protocol that will allow an access to 
multiple banks from a single outlet. This will enable a single branch to 
serve customers of several banks. This will in essence deleverage 
infrastructure of branch from banking business, allow banks to focus on 
service and product and not infrastructure, which is not its core 
competency. Having common branch will drastically reduce the number 
of branches required for given population and area; this will reduce 
operational cost of banking by manifolds.  Protocol we propose uses 
dynamic network switching of the multiple networks to allow the 
common interface to access the API of different participating banks. We 
propose a scalable model which could harness Cloud computing if the 
load on the infrastructure is high. We have also given justification for 
the need of Cost saving for bank branches and potential benefits of 
implementing the proposed model.
