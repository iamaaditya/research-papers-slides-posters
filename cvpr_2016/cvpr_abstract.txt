We propose a version of highway network designed for the task of Visual Question Answering. We take inspiration from recent success of Residual Layer Network and Highway Network in learning deep representation of images and fine grained localization of objects. We propose variation in gating mechanism to allow incorporation of word embedding in the information highway. The gate parameters are influenced by the words in the question, which steers the network towards localized feature learning. This achieves the same effect as soft attention via recurrence but allows for faster training using optimized feed-forward techniques.  We are able to obtain state-of-the-art1 results on VQA dataset for Open Ended and Multiple Choice tasks with current model.
